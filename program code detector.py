Yes, you can use Python to detect running applications or processes on your system. Here's a simple example using the psutil library:

python

import psutil


def find_application(application_name):

    for proc in psutil.process_iter():

        try:

            if proc.name() == application_name:

                return True

        except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, psutil.AccessDenied, psutil.ZombieProcess):

            pass

    return False


# Replace 'chrome' with the desired application name

if find_application('chrome'):

    print("Application is running")

else:

    print("Application is not running")

Replace 'chrome' with the desired application name you want to check. This code will print "Application is running" if the specified application is found, and "Application is not running" otherwise.

Keep in mind that running this code may require appropriate permissions, depending on your system configuration.
